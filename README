This script is aiming to minimize the issues developers face, when they develop on windows and deploy to linux 
using cruise and bundler in their rails application. 
I have created a rake task to call this script before the deployment happen on cruise box 
(fix.rake file: 'cruise:init' rake task)

The script does following jobs:
* remove windows traces
* update the platform details
* run 'bundle install' or 'bundle' command 
* commit the latest Gemfile and Gemgfile.lock to subversion repository

If you are using git or cvs, you just need to replace the svn ci command.

You might also either need to replace the cruise:init task you already have or 
you can use this fix.rake file.
